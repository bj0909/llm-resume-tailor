Dear [Hiring Manager/Recipient Name],

\vspace{10pt}

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities at [Company Name]. I am a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science from ABC University and a strong background in software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I believe my academic experience and hands-on project work make me a strong candidate for roles in software engineering, machine learning, or data science.

During my master’s program, I developed multiple projects that allowed me to apply advanced concepts in real-world scenarios. Notably, I implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to train AI agents for reinforcement learning tasks and created a YOLO-based object detection system with high accuracy. Additionally, I designed an AI-powered chatbot utilizing TensorFlow and deployed it using Docker and REST APIs. My bachelor’s coursework also included building a recommendation system, designing relational databases, and applying machine learning techniques for stock price prediction.

Furthermore, my internship at Tech Solutions Inc. provided me with practical industry experience where I developed RESTful APIs, optimized database queries, and improved application performance. This experience honed my problem-solving skills and reinforced my ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment.

I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to [Company Name] and contribute to your team’s success. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, \\
John Doe
